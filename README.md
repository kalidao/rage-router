# 🔥Rage Router⚡ • [![ci](https://github.com/abigger87/femplate/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/abigger87/femplate/actions/workflows/ci.yml) ![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/kalidao/rage-router?label=license) ![solidity](https://img.shields.io/badge/solidity-^0.8.17-lightgrey)

A common router contract for performing moloch-style redemption of all tokens (ERC20/721/1155).

## Blueprint

```ml
lib
├─ forge-std — https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std
├─ solbase — https://github.com/Sol-DAO/solbase
scripts
├─ Deploy.s.sol — Simple Deployment Script
src
├─ RageRouter — Fair share redemptions for treasury token (ERC20/721/1155) burns
test
└─ RageRouter.t — Exhaustive Tests
```

## Development

**Setup**
```bash
forge install
```

**Building**
```bash
forge build
```

**Testing**
```bash
forge test
```

**Deployment & Verification**

Inside the [`utils/`](./utils/) directory are a few preconfigured scripts that can be used to deploy and verify contracts.

Scripts take inputs from the cli, using silent mode to hide any sensitive information.

_NOTE: These scripts are required to be _executable_ meaning they must be made executable by running `chmod +x ./utils/*`._

_NOTE: these scripts will prompt you for the contract name and deployed addresses (when verifying). Also, they use the `-i` flag on `forge` to ask for your private key for deployment. This uses silent mode which keeps your private key from being printed to the console (and visible in logs)._

### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

🎉 Foundry is installed! 🎉

### Writing Tests with Foundry

With [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), all tests are written in Solidity! 🥳

Create a test file for your contract in the `test/` directory.

### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

For a full list of configuration options, see the Foundry [configuration documentation](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/config/README.md#all-options).
